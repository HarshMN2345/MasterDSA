## Introduction
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of computer science. Mastering DSA is essential for solving complex problems efficiently.

---

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: Measures the time an algorithm takes to run as a function of input size.
- **Space Complexity**: Measures the memory an algorithm uses as a function of input size.

## Data Structures

### Arrays
- Fixed-size data structure.
- Operations: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Searching.

### Linked Lists
- Dynamic data structure.
- Types: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.

### Stacks
- LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure.
- Operations: Push, Pop, Peek.

### Queues
- FIFO (First In, First Out) structure.
- Types: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue.

### Trees
- Hierarchical data structure.
- Types: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, B-Trees.

### Graphs
- Set of nodes connected by edges.
- Representations: Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List.

### Hashing
- Maps keys to values for efficient lookups.
- Techniques: Hash Tables, Collision Resolution.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort.

### Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search, Binary Search.

### Dynamic Programming
- Solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems.

### Greedy Algorithms
- Makes locally optimal choices at each step.

### Backtracking
- Explores all possibilities by building a solution incrementally.

### Divide and Conquer
- Divides the problem into smaller subproblems, solves them, and combines results.
